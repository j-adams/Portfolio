<p style="text-align:center; font-family:'rakkas', cursive;" >My name is Jennifer Adams. I am currently 16 and attend Montgomery High School. My intellectual interests include <br>
  computer science (I love coding!), graphic design, math, and many sciences (especially physics!). I play and have played soccer <br>
  since I was 4 years old. I currently play for both the Jersey Knights and my high school team. I also love running and, aside from running as a hobby, <br>
  I run for my high school track team. This past year I joined my local fire company and am officially a junior volunteer firefighter. More of my hobbies include <br>
  painting, jewelry making (I love being able to see my work getting use!), water color, and most importantly, being able to make my friends laugh. </p>
